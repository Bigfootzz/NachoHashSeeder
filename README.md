generic-seeder
===============

The generic-seeder app is a crawler that can easily be customized for almost any blockchain network. It generates a list of nodes on the network and the most reliable nodes can be exposed via a built-in DNS server or pushed to a remote CloudFlare server.

Features:
- Regularly revisits known nodes to check their availability
- CloudFlare DNS integration
- Block explorer integration
- Keep a running list of all nodes in the network or only show nodes that are above a certain version
- Bans/Unlists nodes after enough failures, or bad behaviour
- Keeps statistics over (exponential) windows of 2 hours, 8 hours, 1 day and 1 week, to base decisions on
- Very low memory (a few tens of megabytes) and cpu requirements
- Run multiple crawlers at the same time (96 threads simultaneously by default)
- Customizable options via configuration file

REQUIREMENTS
------------

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential libboost-all-dev libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libconfig++8-dev
```

CONFIGURE
---------

```
cp ./settings.conf.template ./settings.conf
```

*Make required changes in settings.conf*

COMPILING
---------
Compiling will require boost and ssl.  On debian systems, these are provided
by `libboost-dev` and `libssl-dev` respectively.

```
make
```

This will produce the `dnsseed` binary.

USAGE: LOCAL DNS SERVER MODE
----------------------------

Assuming you want to run a dns seed on dnsseed.example.com, you will
need an authorative NS record in example.com's domain record, pointing
to for example vps.example.com:

```
dig -t NS dnsseed.example.com
```

Example response:

```
;; ANSWER SECTION
dnsseed.example.com.   86400    IN      NS     vps.example.com.
```

On the system vps.example.com, you can now run dnsseed:

```
./dnsseed -h dnsseed.example.com -n vps.example.com
```

If you want the DNS server to report SOA records, please provide an
e-mail address (with the @ part replaced by .) using -m.

USAGE: CLOUDFLARE API MODE
--------------------------

Extra setup is required before CloudFlare mode will work properly.
Run the following cmds:

```
sudo apt-get install python python-setuptools
git clone https://github.com/cloudflare/python-cloudflare
cd python-cloudflare
./setup.py build
sudo ./setup.py install
cd ..
sudo rm -rf python-cloudflare
```

You must also fill in the CloudFlare API config section at the bottom
of the settings.conf file.

Example:

```
cf_domain="example.com"
cf_domain_prefix="dnsseed"
cf_username="your_cloudflare_username"
cf_api_key="your_cloudflare_api_key"
cf_seed_dump="dnsseed.dump"
```

Have the seeder above running all the time, but with no NS record:

```
./dnsseed
```

After a few minutes of running the generic seeder and the dnsseed.dump
file has been populated you can then test CloudFlare mode:

```
python /path/to/seeder/cf-uploader/seeder.py
```

Assuming no errors were reported, you can check that your seeder domain is
working properly by running the following cmd in the format
`nslookup {cf_domain_prefix}.{cf_domain}`:

```
nslookup dnsseed.example.com
```

If everythig is working correctly, you will see a number of "Name:" and
"Address:" lines near the end of the output:

```
Server:         2001:19f1:300:1702::3
Address:        2001:19f1:300:1702::3#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:   dnsseed.example.com
Address: 158.203.13.138
Name:   dnsseed.example.com
Address: 44.76.38.113
Name:   dnsseed.example.com
Address: 46.76.253.117
Name:   dnsseed.example.com
Address: 145.248.52.149
Name:   dnsseed.example.com
Address: 82.240.23.104
Name:   dnsseed.example.com
Address: 103.207.140.36
Name:   dnsseed.example.com
Address: 204.222.30.68
```

Once configured correctly, it is recommended to set up a cron job that will
automatically update the seeds list every 30 minutes or so:

```
*/30 * * * * cd /path/to/seeder/cf-uploader && python seeder.py
```
